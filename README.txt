Zelda Dodger Mini Game

By: Toby Thomas

This is mini game I created, based on my favourite video game series, The Legend of Zelda, to explore the possibilities of object oriented programming and GUIs with Java.

Control Link, as you are trap in a room surrounded by Octoroks! In order to survive, you must dodge their projectiles and kill as many as possible, without losing all your hearts. But watch out! Once you defeat all of the Octoroks on screen, more appear in great numbers! How long can you survive?

Controls:

- Move Link: Arrow keys
- Swing sword / Select Menu item: Spacebar

This game features:

- Multiple objects, for Link, Hearts, the Octoroks, their projectiles and more.
– Animated graphics
– A menu screen
– Two classic Zelda melodies

Enjoy!
